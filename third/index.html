               <div id="text">Out of the night that covers me,<br> 
                    Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br>
              I thank whatever gods may be<br> 
                    For my unconquerable soul.<br> 
              
              In the fell clutch of circumstance <br>
                    I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br> 
              Under the bludgeonings of chance <br>
                    My head is bloody, but unbowed. <br>
              
              Beyond this place of wrath and tears <br>
                    Looms but the Horror of the shade, <br>
              And yet the menace of the years <br>
                    Finds and shall find me unafraid. <br>
              
              It matters not how strait the gate, <br>
                    How charged with punishments the scroll, <br>
              I am the master of my fate, <br>
                    I am the captain of my soul. </div>
